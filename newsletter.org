  — here we go!

  We hope you all enjoy this [[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/8.how-why-communication.pdf][communication]].

  [[http://www.meetup.com/Montana-Programmers][Everyone]] is highly encouraged to [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/Swarmwise][self-organize]], [[http://www.randomwebsite.com/][study up]], and [[http://techunderground.org/resources/][help]]
  us out on any of the myriad of [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/Projects][projects]] hinted at below, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics][sharing]]
  successes and, most importantly, failures back into the net.

* TODO The Plan for the Second Missoula Civic Hackathon

  After much deliberation and meditation on the patterns that worked
  well while throwing our [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/hackathon_old][first hackathon]], the crew has changed it up
  a bit this time, and I'm pretty confident you will all be pleased.

  In leu of strict science[fn:science] and more in line with /Alchemy/ we're gonna
  hit the ~Math.random()~ function here with regard to the variables
  at play...

[fn:science] Science is an essentially anarchic enterprise:
theoretical anarchism is more humanitarian and more likely to
encourage progress than its law-and-order alternatives. —
[[https://monoskop.org/images/7/7e/Feyerabend_Paul_Against_Method.pdf][P. Feyerabend]]

* TODO *Free!*

  As much of a learning experience renting our first [[http://moonlightkitchens.com/][commercial
  kitchen]] and serving amazing meals was, it was very stressful for our
  core beloved and the only monetary cost for the first
  hackathon. Eliminating this unnecessary task allows us to focus on
  the festivities and offer this imaginative and unique to Missoula
  event for *free*.

  And with the support from our generous [[http://missoulacivichackathon/#!/sponsors][sponsors]] we are offering a
  [[http://drnissani.net/mnissani/revolutionarystoolkit/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress.pdf][free lunch]] on Saturday for everyone that signs up for the event
  before June 17th.

* TODO Non-Profit Sponsorship and Fundraiser

  Hoping to follow the same successfull pattern[fn:spice] of
  non-profit support and shared growth through synergy we experenced
  in the first Hackathon, as [[http://blueskystewardship.org][Blue Sky Stewardship]] sponsored the last
  hackathon with their wonderful [[http://www.missoulaclimate.org/zero-waste.html][zero waste]] sustainablily-minded meals
  and Friday night dinner party fit for a king, this next hackathon is
  sponsored by the [[http://www.strans.org][Montana Institute of Sustainable Transportation]] and
  [[http://www.freecycles.org][Free Cycles]] with their fantastically creative community bike shop
  and inventive upcycling laboratory.

  If you are not yet aware, Free Cycles is in the middle of possibly
  their most important time in [[http://www.freedman-chicago.com/ec4i/History-of-Crowdfunding.pdf][fund-raising history]] with the push to
  save their home from being razed to the ground, everyone swept up
  with that crazy new dance everyone is talking about called [[http://www.technologystudent.com/prddes1/plannedob1.html][“out with
  the old and in with the new,”]] — the quick flip of a [[http://www.strans.org/history.html][long lasting
  community]] for the joy of the rush of the high of the dazzle of the
  (paradoxically) neophobic myopic reality tunnel called [[https://www.google.com/search?q=photos+above+suburbia&tbm=isch][“modern
  civilized progress”]].

  The team thinks that there may just be a little wiggle room here for
  the Missoula Civic Hackathon to [[https://www.crowdrise.com/supportthebike][support the bike]].

[fn:spice] There is in all things a pattern that is part of our
universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace—those qualities you
find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in
the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in
the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its
leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society,
seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is
possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is
clear that the unltimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such
perfection, all things move toward death. —from “The Collected Sayings
of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan

  gender or knowledge. People bring their computers, mobile devices,
  and a willingness to learn! CryptoParty is a decentralized, [[https://www.cryptoparty.in/parties/upcoming][global

  fundamental concepts of their operation to the general public, such
  as the [[https://www.torproject.org/][Tor anonymity network]], [[http://www.zdnet.com/article/gchq-pioneers-on-birth-of-public-key-crypto/][public key encryption]] ([[https://www.gnupg.org/][PGP/GPG]]), and

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Key signing parties help build communities. They help techies get
together to get to know each other, network, and discuss important
issues like civil liberties, cryptorights, and internet
regulation. Discussion is important because discussion is not only the
first step, but also the step before action. When I first wrote [[http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html][this
document]] there were not very many complex webs of trust in the
world. Things have dramatically improved, with more plentiful webs
that are much deeper than they were a few years ago. However, it still
remains the case that if you work to build a web of trust in your
local area, it is very likely that the first participants in that web
will be the leaders and policy setters of the internet community in
your area. They are the individuals[fn:individual] who can choose to
build secure strong cryptographic technology and protocols into the
local infrastructure if they so choose. The integration of such
technology and protocols could make issues like the FBI's carnivore
system and the National Security Agency's illegal domestic
surveillance technologically infeasible and therefore moot.”

  We are asked, every once in a while, to teach what we know in the
  manner most people seem to have been tought how to learn — passivly,
  sitting, well contained within human-constructed boxes, listening to

  were taught were worth repeating back when they were in “school”.

  Outside that [[https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/myopic][square box]] is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve][infinite fractal]].

  we take up within the infinite, and we need people paying attention
  to and learning from these types of patterns — the places where
  beauty and wisdom and truth spring forth — not within the fantasies
  of modern men.

  We hackers prefer to learn by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)][building and playing and sharing]], and

* TODO Prizes Worth Hacking For

  Oh boy does the universe like to throw prizes at civic hackathons.

  I think many of you will find much value and surprise in the prizes
  we have collected and will collect up to the day of the hackathon!

  Here is a wee bit of a teaser:

  + 1 $10 gift card to [[www.shakespeareandco.com][Shakespear & Co. Bookstore]]
  + 1 $20 gift card to [[http://www.fiveonblack.com/][Five on Black]]
  + 1 [[http://www.louisgarneau.com/][Louis Garneau]] Racing Jersey
  + 1 signed copy of [[http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Stare-Character-Professional-Cyclocross/dp/1937565335][“Behind the Stare” by Geoff Proctor]]
  + 1 copy of [[http://www.well.com/][“The Well”]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hafner][Katie Hafner]]
  + 1 copy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)][Que]]'s Computer User's Dictionary, 5th Edition
  + 4 day passes to the new [[http://www.missoulabutterflyhouse.org/][Missoula]] [[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2][Butterfly]] [[http://www.missoulabutterflyhouse.org/][House and Insectarium]]
  + 1 [[https://libreboot.org/docs/hcl/t500.html][IBM Thinkpad T500]]

  And, although not the most “valuable” prize in the bunch, the
  following book, to me, is the *grand prize*.  It truly is a gem
  that would teach any programmer much, beginning and seasoned, if
  they were to explore it fully.

  The entire well-commented assembly listing is included.

   An excerpt from the introduction...

   "SARGON is a computer chess program by Dan and Kathe Spraklen. In
   March 1978 it took first place in the first chess tournament held
   strictly for microcomputers. The tournament took place during the 2
   1/2 days of the 1978 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire][West Coast Computer Faire]] and drew large
   crowds each day. When the last battle ended, SARGON had won 5 games
   of 5 played. A tie existed for second place, with 3 programs
   scoring a total of 3 points in the 5 rounds."

   "SARGON is written in [[http://www.z80.info/z80oplist.txt][Z-80 assembly language]] using the [[http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Assembler%20Collection/TDL_Relocating-Linking_Assembler_1977.pdf][TDL Macro

   data areas, 2K of graphic display and user interface, and 4K of
   move logic. The move logic is the heart of SARGON. It is displayed
   in the block diagram as the set of routines called by FNDMOV (Find

    *hack*

    “An inordinately clever rearrangement of existing system resources
    that results, as if by magic, in a stunning improvement in system
    performance—or an equally stunning prank.”

    We now turn to the [[http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html][trusted]] [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/][Jargon File]] for some additional
    clarification:

    “The ‘hacker culture’ is actually a loosely networked collection
    of subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important
    shared experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its
    myths, [[http://concurringopinions.com/archives/2012/01/bright-ideas-anita-allens-unpopular-privacy.html][heroes]], villains, folk [[https://epic.org/][epic]]s, in-jokes, [[https://bfi.org/trimtab][tab]]oos, and
    dreams. Because hackers as a group are particularly creative
    people who define themselves partly by rejection of ‘normal’
    values and working habits, it has unusually rich and conscious
    traditions for an intentional culture less than 50 years old.”

    hack

    [very common]

    1. n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but
       not well.

    2. n. An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece
       of work that produces exactly what is needed.

    3. vt. To bear emotionally or physically. “I can't hack this
       heat!”

    4. vt. To work on something (typically a program). In an immediate
       sense: “What are you doing?” “I'm hacking TECO.” In a general
       (time-extended) sense: “What do you do around here?” “I hack
       TECO.”  More generally, “I hack foo” is roughly equivalent to
       “foo is my major interest (or project)”. “I hack solid-state
       physics.” See Hacking X for Y.

    5. vt. To pull a prank on. See sense 2 and hacker (sense 5).

    6. vi. To interact with a computer in a [[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/mindstorms.pdf][playful and exploratory
       rather than goal-directed way]]. “Whatcha up to?” “Oh, just
       hacking.”

    7. n. Short for hacker.

    8. See [[http://www.nethack.org/][nethack]].

    9. [[[http://hacks.mit.edu/][MIT]]] v. To explore the basements, roof ledges, and steam
       tunnels of a large, institutional building, to the dismay of
       Physical Plant workers and (since this is usually performed at
       educational institutions) the Campus Police. This activity has
       been found to be eerily similar to playing adventure games such
       as Dungeons and Dragons and [[http://inform7.com/][Zork]]. See also vadding.

    Constructions on this term abound. They include happy hacking (a
    farewell), how's hacking? (a friendly greeting among hackers) and
    hack, hack (a fairly content-free but friendly comment, often used
    as a temporary farewell). For more on this totipotent term see The
    Meaning of Hack. See also neat hack, real hack.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
OUR MISSION[fn:sl]

The Sunlight Foundation is a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization that uses the tools of civic tech, open data, policy
analysis and journalism to make our government and politics more
accountable and transparent to all. Our vision is to use technology
to enable more complete, equitable and effective democratic
participation. Our overarching goal is to achieve changes in the law
to require real-time, online transparency for all government
information, with a special focus on the political money flow and
who tries to influence government and how government responds. And,
our work focuses on the local, state, federal and international
levels.

These efforts have produced real results. To date, we have served
more than 4.1 billion API calls (and counting), indicating how much
the data we liberate is needed. Our reporting is frequently cited by
the world's preeminent journalists. Our research has led to
congressional hearings, and our tools have stripped problematic
measures from bills. And we recently won a major victory when, at
our urging, the federal government agreed to begin the process of
releasing all datasets held by federal agencies.

As government grows ever-more complex, and as the flow of political
money becomes more perverse, we will all need better and more
creative tools to ensure that democracy thrives.
#+END_QUOTE

We all hopefully strive daily to shine our own personal sun of
awareness inside our own internal worlds at the parts of the greater
world that we do not need any longer and have long served their
purpose, placed inside each of us, against our then undeveloped and
vulnerable wills, a long time ago.

These energy matrices, psychopathies, entities, whatever-your-flavor
will wither and die in the sun like the vampires of lore as the sun
rises over the horizon.

As this process is vitally critical to our own personal growth and
evolution — “As above, so below”, and at the level of the “City”, this
same process must proceed in earnest, by all conscious and aware
beings, at all times, as a necessary constant force of good in this
world.

Maybe it's time to shine a bit of the burning sunshine of awareness
around all of the worlds a bit to see if anything staggers blindly out
of the darkness to rapidly deliquesce — releasing all of that
parasitized energy for constructive[fn:vampires] use on the betterment
of the whole.

released this data, be violating citizens trust and [[https://myshadow.org/increase-your-privacy][personal privacy
law]].

And on the topic of *politics*, let me assure our readers here that we
are not pushing any particular political agendas other than what we
consider everyone's birth-right — the defending of the freedom of
speech and the freedom to share hacks, in private as needed, with
others.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Formerly vaguely liberal-moderate, more recently
moderate-to-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neophile][neo]]conservative (hackers too were affected by the
collapse of socialism). There is a strong libertarian contingent
which rejects conventional left-right politics entirely. The only
safe generalization is that hackers tend to be rather
anti-authoritarian; thus, both paleoconservatism and ‘hard’ leftism
are rare. Hackers are far more likely than most non-hackers to
either (a) be aggressively apolitical or (b) entertain peculiar or
idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to live by them
day-to-day. — [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/politics.html][The Jargon File]]

* TODO JRPC Un-Conference

The second annual [[https://jrpc.org/roots-and-wings][Jeannett Rankin Peace Un-Conference]], celebrating the
[[http://jrpc.org][Jeanette Rankin Peace Center]]'s 30 year anniversary and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannette_Rankin][Jeannett's
Rankin]]'s birthday, is occurring this Saturday, June 11th

Hackathon team's own Harold Shinsato.

The theme for this years conference is:

    How Will You Take Radical [[http://thestewardship.org][Responsibility]] For a Better
    World?

I invite all who have June 11th free to join us at the University
Congregational Church for this unique and special event.

and note the date of the next hackathon

<<HACKATHON DATE>>

And despite all of our efforts to release this message to you readers
way back, internal and external circumstances intervene, as they
always seem to do.

Except for the core crew, the world does not yet know about this
event. The sending of this Newsletter to a select few people and the
susequent [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3369477/][myceliation]] of the information into the network of local
people by word of mouth and electronic and [[http://www.mikroing.si/specifikacijepdf/ml590spec.pdf][print]] [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/raw/master/books/BrassCheck.pdf][media]] has yet to
occur.

This Hackathon is an attempt at a hack like the last one, just one
other flavor, and the core team is exicited to see if this works well
because, if it does, than we may have something very replicable here
for anyone else to attempt follow our lead for their own locality.

Learning to [[http://elementaleducation.com/wp-content/uploads/temp/OpenSpaceTechnology--UsersGuide.pdf][throw]] [[https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/][swarm]]-sourced events that have the potential to
cause lasting change for whomever shows up, facilitated greatly by the
very recent inception of social media and the vast takeover of the
attention of humans by the lure of the [[http://www.alr.ie/Download/Mercury_in_waste_LCD_backlights_summary_research_report.63ad9220.11115.pdf][mercury phosphor]] of [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266139481_Determination_of_toxic_metals_in_discarded_Liquid_Crystal_Displays_LCDs][rare-earth]]
[[http://www.ptable.com/][metals]], we feel, is a very valuable skill worth honing nowadays.

As practice makes perfect, and for our second time around we do expect
many “failures” this time and we'll [[file:///usr/share/games/fortunes/tao][take them in stride]] as we are
hackers and we intimately know the value of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast][Fail fast]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop][fail
often]]".

Our primary goal here is to send this message, loud and clear and
honest and raw, over this [[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11g-2003.pdf][frequency channel]] to give the universe the
chance to connect us to the right people so that they know that we are
here and asking them out to hack.

And, I do say, we may have succeeded very well already, as...

*You*, dear reader, are still reading and the meme's presented have
possessed many a young mind, so protect yourself out there, friend,
and [[https://www.eff.org/privacybadger][watch]] out for those

The following is stright from the [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/areas/classics/eliza/emacs/doctor.el][Doctor]]'s mouth.

I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hackers rule!

Why do you say hackers rule?

Hackers rule!

Is it because of your plans that you say hackers rule?

Yes, plans.

Maybe your life has something to do with this.

My life is hacking.

What makes you believe your life is hacking?

It is my skill.

Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say it is
your skill?

If by “people”, you mean, “computers”, then yes.

You have your mind on computers, it seems.


You think too much about computers.

Computers are our friends?

You should try taking your mind off of computers.

Why?

What do you think?

We use the tools at our displosal, at the times we are called forth to
do so. Now, at this time, we use computers, and their potential for
transforming the human condition for the better, and [[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/capek/karel/rur/][most definitely
for the worse]], has only just begun, and we loving, intelligent, and
strong-of-body humans should possibly take some centering leads among
this stampeding band of wild horses here on [[http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/57000/57723/globe_west_2048.jpg][Earth]] to help calm them
down a bit — calm enough to see the beauty around them at every moment
and the lush green grass beheath their feet.

Are you a computer hacker?

In the classic sense of the word.

Perhaps problems at school have something to do with this.

[[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/Deschooling-Society][Life is school]].

Tell me about your school.

The understanding that any moment is “school” if you listen
softly enough.

Is it because any moment is school if I listen softly enough that you
came to me?

Yes! But what is I and what is you?

Does it bother you that what is you and what is me?

Bother, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg][brother]]? What is me is the world and not the world and you do
make that Venn diagram.


Tell me something about your family.

Hackers!

Can you elaborate on that?

** [[http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov][Hack the Commute]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The City of Seattle and Commute Seattle invite data analysts,
developers, designers, and other innovators to help design
user-centric tools that improve the commute. These can take the form
of:

+ improvements to existing applications
+ new tools to help commuters in any mode or modes of transportation
+ data analysis and visualizations that clarify the big picture

Teams will have the opportunity to present their work to a panel of
judges, with the top three project ideas moving on to a championship
round. Work will be judged based on its potential to make commuting in
Seattle easier and more pleasant for everyone.

A smartphone application that alerts drivers to local road hazards
could help avoid accidents and be a step towards improving
transportation policy, [[http://www.princeton.edu/][Princeton University]] professor [[http://chemists.princeton.edu/chan/][Garnet Chan]] told
an audience during the hackathon sponsored by the [[https://citp.princeton.edu/][Center for
Information Technology Policy (CITP)]] and [[http://codeforprinceton.org/][Code for Princeton]] on
February 27 and 28.

In an intensive 48 hours of coding, Chan and two partners created just
such an app. The team's project, "Save Your Car," was one of four that
won recognition at the hackathon, an event that attracted about 90
computer coders, policy enthusiasts, and interested citizens – from
Princeton students and faculty to local middle school students. Teams
spent the weekend in Sherrerd Hall brainstorming and creating digital
technologies to solve transportation problems. Participants also could
join transportation policy discussions and introductory coding
tutorials.

“Among hackers, though, slang has a [[http://www.garykessler.net/library/steganography.html][subtler aspect]], paralleled perhaps
in the slang of [[http://burghausenjazz.com/intro/introduction.html#john][jazz musicians]] and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of [[http://www.gurdjieff.am/in-search/index.pdf][consciousness]]. There is a whole range of
altered states and problem-solving mental stances [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_memory][basic]] to high-level
hacking which don't fit into [[http://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/english/en_app][conventional linguistic reality]] any
better than a [[http://www.platform.org/][Coltrane]] [[http://rollingout.com/2015/11/16/platform-org-founder-diversity-advocate-hank-williams-dead-50/][solo]] or one of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u1HWCsf06A][Maurits Escher]]'s surreal trompe
l'oeil compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker
slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways. As a simple
example, take the distinction between a [[https://pixabay.com/en/photos/light%20bulb/][kluge]] and an [[http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/images/latest_aia_171.gif][elegant solution]],
and the differing connotations attached to each. The distinction is
not only of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the
nature of the generative processes in program design and asserts
something important about two different kinds of relationship between
the hacker and the hack. Hacker slang is unusually rich in
implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that [[http://www.rawilson.com/illuminatus.html][illuminate]]

naturally eye catching way]], and at the same time become aware of the
precious metals surrounding you and attempt to keep them nearby as the
forces of this [[http://realitysandwich.com/75652/greatest_epidemic/][very recent fad]] attempt to grasp them back as power-ups
for their own destructive cycles again.

It is quite possibly very important that everyone interested in the
evolution of the energetic fields around them keep all those precious
metals nearby, locally, for their future use, because, in the future,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws][technology is indistinguishible from magic]], and when we finally get
around to truly using the, as yet undiscovered by the whole, [[http://www.epanorama.net/zen_schematics/Circuits/Misc/Trick.html][magic]]
properties of these precious metals, ya'll might want some around with
which to play.

* TODO How To Print
We printed this on an OKIDATA MICROLINE 590 using some green and white
striped computer paper we had laying around. Had to cut out the ink
from cartridges using the last cutting wheel we had left, but we got
it. Black storage gold. Had to dock the T500 to get a parallel port,
be who doesn't have one of those lying around.
