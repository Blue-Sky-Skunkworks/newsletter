* DONE Welcome!

  Hello fellow civic hackers,

  Less than a fortnight until the second Missoula Civic Hackathon and
  the core team has much to share in ...

* DONE Our First Install(ment)

  of the Missoula Civic Hackathon Newsletter - Transporation Edition

  Version 1.0 — here we go!

  We hope you all enjoy this [[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/8.how-why-communication.pdf][communication]].

  [[http://www.meetup.com/Montana-Programmers][Everyone]] is highly encouraged to [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/Swarmwise][self-organize]] and help us out on
  any of the myriad of projects hinted at below, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics][communicating]] all
  results back into the net.

* DONE The Plan for the Second Missoula Civic Hackathon

  After much deliberation and meditation on the successes and failures
  of throwing our first hackathon, the crew has changed it up a bit
  this time, and I'm pretty confident you will all be pleased.

  In leu of strict science and more in line with /Alchemy/ we're
  gonna hit the ~Math.random()~ function here with regard to the
  variables at play...

* DONE *Free!*

  As much of a learning experience renting our own commercial kitchen
  and serving amazing meals was, it was very stressful for our core
  beloved and the only monetary cost for the first
  hackathon. Eliminating this unnecessary task allows us to focus on
  the festivities and offer this imaginative and unique to Missoula
  event for *free*.

  And with the support from our generous sponsors we are offering a
  [[http://drnissani.net/mnissani/revolutionarystoolkit/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress.pdf][free lunch]] on Saturday to everyone that <<URL>> signs up for the
  event before June 17th.

* TODO Non-Profit Sponsorship and Fundraiser

  Hoping to follow the same successfull pattern of non-profit support
  and shared growth through synergy we experenced in the first
  Hackathon, as [[http://blueskystewardship.org][Blue Sky Stewardship]] sponsored the last hackathon with
  their wonderful [[http://www.missoulaclimate.org/zero-waste.html][zero waste]] sustainablily-minded meals and Friday
  night dinner party fit for a king, this next hackathon is sponsored
  by the [[http://www.strans.org][Montana Institute of Sustainable Transportation]] and [[http://www.freecycles.org][Free
  Cycles]] with their fantastically creative community bike shop and
  inventive upcycling laboratory.

  If you are not yet aware, Free Cycles is in the middle of possibly
  their most important time in [[http://www.freedman-chicago.com/ec4i/History-of-Crowdfunding.pdf][fund-raising history]] with the push to
  save their home from being razed to the ground, everyone swept up
  with that crazy new dance everyone is talking about called “out with
  the old and in with the new,” — the quick flip of a long lasting
  community for the joy of the rush of the high of the dazzle of the
  phantasmagoria of the myopic reality tunnel called “modern civilized
  progress”.

  The team thinks that there may just be a little wiggle room here for
  the Missoula Civic Hackathon to [[https://www.crowdrise.com/supportthebike][support the bike]].

* TODO Carnival!!!

  The [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/TAZ][Temporary Autonomous Zone]] myriad mix of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer][summer festival
  tradition]], [[http://lispacademy.org/][Ancient Greek Academy]], brothers and sisters sharing,

* TODO Constructionism
  We are asked, every once in a while, to teach what we know in the
  manner most people seem to learn nowadays — passivly, sitting, well
  contained within human-constructed boxes, listening to other humans
  or humanly created machines parrot human thoughts they were taught
  were worth repeating.

  Outside that square box is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve][infinite fractal]]. And that [[http://tilde.club/~david/m/#zoom=0.011285668314080708,0.006462388641753358&lookAt=-0.21900509262792986,-0.8106778502752179&iterations=1889&superSamples=1&escapeRadius=10.0&colorScheme=pickColorGrayscale][fractal]]
  cares not much for human thought, such a drop in the [[http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2012-37-a-full_jpg.jpg][ocean]] of [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html][time]]
  we take up within the infinite, and we need people paying attention
  to and learning from these types of patterns — the places where
  beauty and wisdom and truth spring forth — not within the fantasies
  of modern men.

  We hackers prefer to learn by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)][building and playing and sharing]], and
  we love to teach this “skill” to anyone that can play fair and
  share, because we know one of the best hacks to learning is
  teaching and it's not like it's not a skill we didn't all hopefully
  learn to do as children, so join alongside us as we attempt to look
  upon the world with a fractal child's wonder as we leave the rest
  for the 🅂 🅀 🅄 🄰 🅁 🄴 🅂  .

* TODO Prizes Worth Hacking For

  Oh boy does the universe like to throw prizes at civic hackathons.

  I think many of you will find much value and surprise in the prizes
  we have collected and will collect up to the day of the hackathon!

  Here is a wee bit of a teaser:

  + 1 $10 gift card to [[www.shakespeareandco.com][Shakespear & Co. Bookstore]]
  + 1 $20 gift card to [[http://www.fiveonblack.com/][Five on Black]]
  + 1 [[http://www.louisgarneau.com/][Louis Garneau]] Racing Jersey
  + 1 signed copy of [[http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Stare-Character-Professional-Cyclocross/dp/1937565335][“Behind the Stare” by Geoff Proctor]]
  + 1 copy of [[http://www.well.com/][“The Well”]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hafner][Katie Hafner]]
  + 1 copy of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)][Que]]'s Computer User's Dictionary, 5th Edition
  + 4 day passes to the new [[http://www.missoulabutterflyhouse.org/][Missoula Insectarium]]
  + 1 IBM Thinkpad T500

  And, although not the most “valuable” prize in the bunch, the
  following book, to me, is the *grand prize*.  It truly is a gem
  that would teach any programmer much, beginning and seasoned, if
  they were to explore it fully.

  The entire well-commented assembly listing is included.

   Published November 1, 1978

   An excerpt from the introduction...

   "SARGON is a computer chess program by Dan and Kathe Spraklen. In
   March 1978 it took first place in the first chess tournament held
   strictly for microcomputers. The tournament took place during the 2
   1/2 days of the 1978 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire][West Coast Computer Faire]] and drew large
   crowds each day. When the last battle ended, SARGON had won 5 games
   of 5 played. A tie existed for second place, with 3 programs
   scoring a total of 3 points in the 5 rounds."

   "SARGON is written in [[http://www.z80.info/z80oplist.txt][Z-80 assembly language]] using the [[http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Assembler%20Collection/TDL_Relocating-Linking_Assembler_1977.pdf][TDL Macro
   Assembler]]. The program occupies 8K of RAM, which includes 2K of
   data areas, 2K of graphic display and user interface, and 4K of
   move logic. The move logic is the heart of SARGON. It is displayed
   in the block diagram as the set of routines called by FNDMOV (Find
   Move). FNDMOVE controls..[[http://www.benlo.com/microchess/Kim-1Microchess.html][.]]"
* TODO Holding Space

  The Missoula Civic Hackathon team [[http://esgs.free.fr/uk/art/sands.htm][is]] holding this space, tentativly
  now, but we are asking for all of your help to solidify this hold.

  You participate in our activities by showing up and being yourself.

  We all love this stuff, but the modern world demands its high tax on
  the true wealths of this world, one being time, and if this song is
  close enough to your own personal song to join this choir, and you
  have that precious time to spare, come be awkward with the rest of
  us “nerds” — as we hack this world for the better, together.

    *hack*

    “An inordinately clever rearrangement of existing system resources
    that results, as if by magic, in a stunning improvement in system
    performance—or an equally stunning prank.”

    We now turn to the trusty [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/][Jargon File]] for some additional
    clarification:

    “The ‘hacker culture’ is actually a loosely networked collection
    of subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important
    shared experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its
    own myths, heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and
    dreams. Because hackers as a group are particularly creative
    people who define themselves partly by rejection of ‘normal’
    values and working habits, it has unusually rich and conscious
    traditions for an intentional culture less than 50 years old.”

    hack

    [very common]

    1. n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but
       not well.

    2. n. An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece
       of work that produces exactly what is needed.

    3. vt. To bear emotionally or physically. “I can't hack this
       heat!”

    4. vt. To work on something (typically a program). In an immediate
       sense: “What are you doing?” “I'm hacking TECO.” In a general
       (time-extended) sense: “What do you do around here?” “I hack
       TECO.”  More generally, “I hack foo” is roughly equivalent to
       “foo is my major interest (or project)”. “I hack solid-state
       physics.” See Hacking X for Y.

    5. vt. To pull a prank on. See sense 2 and hacker (sense 5).

    6. vi. To interact with a computer in a [[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/mindstorms.pdf][playful and exploratory
       rather than goal-directed way]]. “Whatcha up to?” “Oh, just
       hacking.”

    7. n. Short for hacker.

    8. See [[http://www.nethack.org/][nethack]].

    9. [[[http://hacks.mit.edu/][MIT]]] v. To explore the basements, roof ledges, and steam
       tunnels of a large, institutional building, to the dismay of
       Physical Plant workers and (since this is usually performed at
       educational institutions) the Campus Police. This activity has
       been found to be eerily similar to playing adventure games such
       as Dungeons and Dragons and [[http://inform7.com/][Zork]]. See also vadding.

    Constructions on this term abound. They include happy hacking (a
    farewell), how's hacking? (a friendly greeting among hackers) and
    hack, hack (a fairly content-free but friendly comment, often used
    as a temporary farewell). For more on this totipotent term see The
    Meaning of Hack. See also neat hack, real hack.
* TODO Batteries - or how Missoula began loving [[http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/6.how-why-electronics.pdf][electric]] bicycles

The wicked sharp and generous people at [[https://www.opportunityecycling.org/][Opportunity E-Cycling]], out
near the airport, who are busy diligently keeping Missoula's aging
electronics from polluting our own landfill, have donated a box of
used laptop batteries destined for being shipped[fn:shipped]
out[fn:out] of town and we at the Missoula Civic Hackathon thought we
might be able to put a few of them to use here in town.

First test — popped in a dusty 9-cell Li-ion into my trusted

Just a wee bit of research and it looks like we have a pretty “new”
laptop battery here...

Lithium-ion batteries, especially for the purposes we intend to use
these batteries, [[https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf][really don't loose much]] even after 500 cycles.

The battery powering the laptop this text is being entered into, with
over 4 hours remaining of battery power, was the first battery I tried
out of the box of 50 lbs., and we may have beginners luck here, or we
may just have found a very valuable and untapped stream of [[http://storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-stuff/][“waste”]] of
electrical energy storage material, unheard of ever in the history of
humanity — ready for hacking.

  Civic Hackathon!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
OUR MISSION[fn:sl]

The Sunlight Foundation is a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization that uses the tools of civic tech, open data, policy
analysis and journalism to make our government and politics more
accountable and transparent to all. Our vision is to use technology
to enable more complete, equitable and effective democratic
participation. Our overarching goal is to achieve changes in the law
to require real-time, online transparency for all government
information, with a special focus on the political money flow and
who tries to influence government and how government responds. And,
our work focuses on the local, state, federal and international
levels.

These efforts have produced real results. To date, we have served
more than 4.1 billion API calls (and counting), indicating how much
the data we liberate is needed. Our reporting is frequently cited by
the world's preeminent journalists. Our research has led to
congressional hearings, and our tools have stripped problematic
measures from bills. And we recently won a major victory when, at
our urging, the federal government agreed to begin the process of
releasing all datasets held by federal agencies.

As government grows ever-more complex, and as the flow of political
money becomes more perverse, we will all need better and more
creative tools to ensure that democracy thrives.
#+END_QUOTE

We all hopefully strive daily to shine our own personal sun of
awareness inside our own internal worlds at the parts of the greater
world that we do not need any longer and have long served their
purpose, placed inside each of us, against our then undeveloped and
vulnerable wills, a long time ago.

These energy matrices, psychopathies, entities, whatever-your-flavor
will wither and die in the sun like the vampires of lore as the sun
rises over the horizon.

As this process is vitally critical to our own personal growth and
evolution — “As above, so below”, and at the level of the “City”, this
same process must proceed in earnest, by all conscious and aware
beings, at all times, as a necessary constant force of good in this
world.

Maybe it's time to shine a bit of the burning sunshine of awareness
around all of the worlds a bit to see if anything staggers blindly out
of the darkness to rapidly deliquesce — releasing all of that
parasitized energy for constructive[fn:vampires] use on the betterment
of the whole.

* TODO US City Open Data Census

The Missoula Civic Hackathon team is now shouldering the “librarian”
role for the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/][US City Open Data Census]] and we invite anyone interested
in participating in the census to read the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/about/][Introduction]] and [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/faq/][FAQ]], from
which we copy below the list of data sets we are requesting help on
locating.

We are *not*, we repeat, *not*, at this particular time,
requesting the city government to release any data sets they have
contained in non publicly-accessible databases, many of which are,
understandibly, internally coupled to and expensive to decouple from
highly personal data that the City of Missoula would be violating
citizens trust and personal privacy law to release into the wild.

And on the topic of *politics*, let me assure our readers here that we
are not pushing any particular political agendas other than what we
consider our birth-right — freedom of expression and the freedom to
share with others.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Formerly vaguely liberal-moderate, more recently
moderate-to-neoconservative (hackers too were affected by the
collapse of socialism). There is a strong libertarian contingent
which rejects conventional left-right politics entirely. The only
safe generalization is that hackers tend to be rather
anti-authoritarian; thus, both paleoconservatism and ‘hard’ leftism
are rare. Hackers are far more likely than most non-hackers to
either (a) be aggressively apolitical or (b) entertain peculiar or
idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to live by them
day-to-day. — [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/politics.html][The Jargon File]]

* TODO JRPC Un-Conference

The second annual [[https://jrpc.org/roots-and-wings][Jeannett Rankin Peace Un-Conference]], celebrating the
[[http://jrpc.org][Jeanette Rankin Peace Center]]'s 30 year anniversary and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannette_Rankin][Jeannett's
Rankin]]'s birthday, is occurring this Saturday, June 11th
8:30a.m.–5:30p.m. with an all day Un-Conference facilitated by the
Hackathon team's own Harold Shinsato.

The theme for this years conference is:

    How Will You Take Radical <<FIX>> [[http://thestewardship.org][Responsibility]] For a Better
    World?

I invite all who have June 11th free to join us at the University
Congregational Church for this unique and special event.

and note the date of the next hackathon

<<HACKATHON DATE>>

And despite all of our efforts to release this message to you readers
way back, internal and external circumstances intervene, as they
always seem to do.

Except for the core crew, the world does not yet know about this
event. The sending of this Newsletter and the susequent [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3369477/][myceliation]] of
the information into the network of local people by word of mouth and
electronic and print [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/raw/master/books/BrassCheck.pdf][media]] has yet to occur.

This Hackathon is an attempt at a hack like the last one, just one
other flavor, and the core team is exicited to see if this works well
because, if it does, than we may have something very replicable here
for anyone else to attempt follow our lead for their own locality.

Learning to throw [[https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/][swarm]]-sourced events that have the potential to
cause lasting change for whomever shows up, facilitated greatly by the
very recent inception of social media and the vast takeover of the
attention of humans by the lure of the [[http://www.alr.ie/Download/Mercury_in_waste_LCD_backlights_summary_research_report.63ad9220.11115.pdf][mercury phosphor]] of [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266139481_Determination_of_toxic_metals_in_discarded_Liquid_Crystal_Displays_LCDs][rare-earth]]
[[http://www.ptable.com/][metals]], we feel, is a very valuable skill worth honing nowadays.

As practice makes perfect, and for our second time around we do expect
many “failures” this time and we'll [[http://www.taoism.net/ttc/complete.htm][take them in stride]] as we are
hackers and we intimately know the value of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast][Fail fast]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop][fail
often]]".

Our primary goal here is to send this message, loud and clear and
honest and raw, over this frequency channel to give the universe the
chance to connect us to the right people so that they know that we are
here and asking them out to play.

And, I do say, we may have succeeded very well already, as...

*You*, dear reader, are still reading and the [[http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/694/604][meme]]s presented have
possessed many a young mind, so protect yourself out there, friend,

The following is stright from the [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/areas/classics/eliza/emacs/doctor.el][Doctor]]'s mouth.

I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hackers rule!

Why do you say hackers rule?

Hackers rule!

Is it because of your plans that you say hackers rule?

Yes, plans.

Maybe your life has something to do with this.

My life is hacking.

What makes you believe your life is hacking?

It is my skill.

Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say it is
your skill?

If by “people”, you mean, “computers”, then yes.

You have your mind on computers, it seems.


You think too much about computers.

Computers are our friends?

You should try taking your mind off of computers.

Why?

What do you think?

We use the tools at our displosal, at the times we are called forth to
do so. Now, at this time, we use computers, and their potential for
transforming the human condition for the better, and [[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/c/capek/karel/rur/][most definitely
for the worse]], has only just begun, and we loving, intelligent, and
strong-of-body humans should possibly take some centering leads among
this stampeding band of wild horses here on [[http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/57000/57723/globe_west_2048.jpg][Earth]] to help calm them
down a bit — calm enough to see the beauty around them at every moment
and the lush green grass beheath their feet.

Are you a computer hacker?

In the classic sense of the word.

Perhaps problems at school have something to do with this.

[[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/Deschooling-Society][Life is school]].

Tell me about your school.

The understanding that any moment is “school” if you listen
softly enough.

Is it because any moment is school if I listen softly enough that you
came to me?

Yes! But what is I and what is you?

Does it bother you that what is you and what is me?

Bother, brother? What is me is the world and not the world and you do
make that Venn diagram.


Tell me something about your family.

Hackers!

Can you elaborate on that?

Cypherpunks, [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=poetic%20terrorism][poetic terrorists]], [[http://www.instructables.com/][tinkerers]], [[http://google.com][sentient AI]]'s, — you know —
[[https://github.com/showcases/programming-languages][the usual]].

Are you sure that cypherpunks tinkerers sentient ai's I know the
usual?

* TODO A Couple Recent Transportation Hackathons
** [[http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov][Hack the Commute]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The City of Seattle and Commute Seattle invite data analysts,
developers, designers, and other innovators to help design
user-centric tools that improve the commute. These can take the form
of:

+ improvements to existing applications
+ new tools to help commuters in any mode or modes of transportation
+ data analysis and visualizations that clarify the big picture

Teams will have the opportunity to present their work to a panel of
judges, with the top three project ideas moving on to a championship
round. Work will be judged based on its potential to make commuting in
Seattle easier and more pleasant for everyone.

A smartphone application that alerts drivers to local road hazards
could help avoid accidents and be a step towards improving
transportation policy, [[http://www.princeton.edu/][Princeton University]] professor [[http://chemists.princeton.edu/chan/][Garnet Chan]] told
an audience during the hackathon sponsored by the [[https://citp.princeton.edu/][Center for
Information Technology Policy (CITP)]] and [[http://codeforprinceton.org/][Code for Princeton]] on
February 27 and 28.

In an intensive 48 hours of coding, Chan and two partners created just
such an app. The team's project, "Save Your Car," was one of four that
won recognition at the hackathon, an event that attracted about 90
computer coders, policy enthusiasts, and interested citizens – from
Princeton students and faculty to local middle school students. Teams
spent the weekend in Sherrerd Hall brainstorming and creating digital
technologies to solve transportation problems. Participants also could
join transportation policy discussions and introductory coding
tutorials.
