* Welcome!

  Hello fellow civic hackers,

  Less than a fortnight until the second Missoula Civic Hackathon and
  the core team has much to share in ...

* The First Installment of Our Newsletter

  Version 1.0 — here we go!

  I hope you all enjoy this message and everyone is highly encouraged
  to self-organize and help out on any of the myriad of paths below,
  communicating results back into the net.

* Plan for the Second Missoula Civic Hackathon

  After much deliberation and meditation on the successes and failures
  of the last hackathon, the crew has changed it up a bit this time,
  and I'm pretty confident you will all be pleased.

  In leu of strict science and more in line with /Alchemy/ we're
  gonna hit the ~Math.random()~ function here with regard to the
  variables at play...

* Free!

  As much of a learning experience renting our own commercial kitchen
  and serving amazing meals was, it was very stressful for our core
  beloved and the only monetary cost for the first hackathon. Removing
  this task allows us to focus on the festivities and offer this
  imaginative and unique to Missoula event for free.

  And with the support from our generous sponsors we are offering a
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress][free lunch]], Saturday, to everyone that signs up for the event before
  June 17th.

* Non-Profit Sponsorship and Fundraiser

  Hoping to follow the same successfull pattern of non-profit support
  and shared growth through synergy we experenced in the first
  Hackathon, as [[http://blueskystewardship.org][Blue Sky Stewardship]] sponsored the last hackathon with
  their wonderful [[http://www.missoulaclimate.org/zero-waste.html][zero waste]] sustainablily-minded meals and Friday
  night dinner party, this hackathon is sponsored by the [[http://www.strans.org][Montana
  Institute of Sustainable Transportation]] and [[http://www.freecycles.org][Free Cycles]] with their
  fantastically creative community bike shop and inventive up-cycling
  laboratory.

  If you are not yet aware, Free Cycles is in the middle of possibly
  their most important time in fund-raising history with the push to
  save their home from being razed to the ground, everyone swept up
  with that crazy new dance everyone is talking about called “out with
  the old and in with the new,” the quick flip of a long lasting
  community for the joy of the rush of the high of the dazzle of the
  phantasmagoria of the myopic reality tunnel called “modern civilized
  progress”.

  The team here thinks that there may be just a little wiggle room
  here for the Missoula Civic Hackathon to [[https://www.crowdrise.com/supportthebike][support the bike]].

* Carnival!!!

  The [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/TAZ][Temporary Autonomous Zone]] myriad mix of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer][summer festival
  tradition]], [[http://lispacademy.org/][Ancient Greek Academy]], brothers and sisters sharing,
  skills and thrills, connection and conversation, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers][Starship Troopers]]
  and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]] re-enacted using miniature [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenber][Braitenberg vehicles]]
  self-assembling out of discarded [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste][electronic waste]] suspiciously
  stamped [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer]["Chiba City,'53"]], races to the finish line, winners and
  learner, silence and centering, [[http://missoulacivichackathon.org/#!/prayer][prayer]] and peace.

* The Dictionary Definition of *Hack*

On one of our my little runs around town meeting the wonderful shop
owners and managers of Missoula, Jolie Anderson over at the [[http://www.birdsnestbooks.com/][Bird's
Nest Books]] donated a few extra-ordinary prizes, and as [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/William-Halliburton][Will]] sat, in
the Missoula First Friday sunshine, enjoying a free coffee out on a
Burning Man'esque streetside [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parklet][parklet]] erected by [[http://www.factandfictionbooks.com][Fact and Fiction]],

    *hack*

    “An inordinately clever rearrangement of existing system resources
    that results, as if my magic, in a stunning improvement in system
    performance—or an equally stunning prank.”

* Batteries - or how Missoula began loving electric bicycles

The wicked sharp and generous people out at the new [[https://www.opportunityecycling.org/][Opportunity
E-Cycling]], out near the airport, have donated a box of used laptop
batteries destined for being shipped[fn:1] out[fn:2] of town and we at
the Missoula Civic Hackathon thought we might be able to put a few of
them to use here in town.

First test — popped in a dusty 9-cell Li-ion into my trusted [[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T500][Thinkpad
T500]] yesterday to a "charging 0.1%" and now, as I pull the cord to the
sound of "battery power active", my guages read:

Just a wee bit of research and it looks like we have a pretty “new”
laptop battery here...

Lithium-ion batteries, especially for the purposes we intend to us
these batteries, [[https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf][really don't loose much]] even after 500 cycles.

The battery powering the laptop this text is being entered, with over
4 hours remaining of battery power, was the first battery I tried out
of the box of 50 lbs., and we may have beginners luck here, or we may
just have found a very valuable and untapped stream of “waste” of
electrical energy storage material, unheard of ever in the history of
humanity — ready for the hacking.

* US City Open Data Census

The Missoula Civic Hackathon team is now shouldering the “librarian”
role for the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/][US City Open Data Census]] and we invite anyone interested
in participating in the census to read the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/about/][Introduction]] and [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/faq/][FAQ]], from
which we copy below the list of data sets we are requesting help on
locating.  We are /not/, we repeat, /not/, at this particular time,
requesting the city government to release data sets they have
contained in non publicly-accessible databases, many of which are
understandibly internally coupled to and expensive to decouple from
highly personal data that the City of Missoula would be violating
citizens trust and personal privacy law to release into the wild. This
is only a census.

As nothing is truly static in this world and all things, great and
small, are either evolving or devolving, we know which side of this
deeply personal existential flip-trap we want to land — on our feet,
running fast, concious and loving and open to new ways of attempting
to evolve our own collective reality together. There is just too much
[[http://www.kpax.com/story/31573624/civic-hackathon-brainstorms-environmental-solutions][“low hanging fruit”]] at this time on earth for us hackers to address,
[[http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/hackathon/Content?oid=2756399][falling to the ground in bushels]], to waste any critical energy on
needless conflict, almost always rooted in miss-understanding and
miss-communications, and with the infinite fractal of beautiful
graceful hacks left to perform together, and we do need [[http://www.census.gov/popclock/][all of us]] now,
we perfer to work out our differences along-side each other, out in
the field, doing what we do best — Hacking.
