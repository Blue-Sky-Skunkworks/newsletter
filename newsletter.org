* Welcome!

  Hello fellow civic hackers,

  Less than a fortnight until the second Missoula Civic Hackathon and
  the core team has much to share in ...

* Our First Install(ment)

  Version 1.0 — here we go!

  I hope you all enjoy this message and everyone is highly encouraged
  to self-organize and help out on any of the myriad of paths below,
  communicating results back into the net.

* Plan for the Second Missoula Civic Hackathon

  After much deliberation and meditation on the successes and failures
  of the last hackathon, the crew has changed it up a bit this time,
  and I'm pretty confident you will all be pleased.

  In leu of strict science and more in line with /Alchemy/ we're
  gonna hit the ~Math.random()~ function here with regard to the
  variables at play...

* Free!

  As much of a learning experience renting our own commercial kitchen
  and serving amazing meals was, it was very stressful for our core
  beloved and the only monetary cost for the first hackathon. Removing
  this task allows us to focus on the festivities and offer this
  imaginative and unique to Missoula event for free.

  And with the support from our generous sponsors we are offering a
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress][free lunch]], Saturday, to everyone that signs up for the event before
  June 17th.

* Non-Profit Sponsorship and Fundraiser

  Hoping to follow the same successfull pattern of non-profit support
  and shared growth through synergy we experenced in the first
  Hackathon, as [[http://blueskystewardship.org][Blue Sky Stewardship]] sponsored the last hackathon with
  their wonderful [[http://www.missoulaclimate.org/zero-waste.html][zero waste]] sustainablily-minded meals and Friday
  night dinner party, this hackathon is sponsored by the [[http://www.strans.org][Montana
  Institute of Sustainable Transportation]] and [[http://www.freecycles.org][Free Cycles]] with their
  fantastically creative community bike shop and inventive up-cycling
  laboratory.

  If you are not yet aware, Free Cycles is in the middle of possibly
  their most important time in fund-raising history with the push to
  save their home from being razed to the ground, everyone swept up
  with that crazy new dance everyone is talking about called “out with
  the old and in with the new,” the quick flip of a long lasting
  community for the joy of the rush of the high of the dazzle of the
  phantasmagoria of the myopic reality tunnel called “modern civilized
  progress”.

  The team here thinks that there may be just a little wiggle room
  here for the Missoula Civic Hackathon to [[https://www.crowdrise.com/supportthebike][support the bike]].

* Carnival!!!

  The [[https://github.com/Blue-Sky-Skunkworks/missoula-civic-hackathon-notes/wiki/TAZ][Temporary Autonomous Zone]] myriad mix of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer][summer festival
  tradition]], [[http://lispacademy.org/][Ancient Greek Academy]], brothers and sisters sharing,
  skills and thrills, connection and conversation, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers][Starship Troopers]]
  and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]] re-enacted using miniature [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenber][Braitenberg vehicles]]

  stamped [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer]["Chiba City,'53"]], races to the finish line, winners and
  learner, silence and centering, [[http://missoulacivichackathon.org/#!/prayer][prayer]] and peace.
* Prizes Worth Hacking For

  Oh boy does the universe like to throw prizes at hackathons.

  I think many of you will find much value and surprises in the prizes
  we have collected and will collect up to the day of the hackathon!

  Here is a wee bit of a teaser..

  + 4 day passes to the new [[http://www.missoulabutterflyhouse.org/][Missoula Insectarium]]
  + 1 $20 gift card to Five on Black
  + 1 Louis Garneau Racing Jersey
  + 1 signed copy of [[http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Stare-Character-Professional-Cyclocross/dp/1937565335][“Behind the Stare” by Geoff Proctor]]
  + 1 copy of “The Well” by

  And, although not the most “valuable” prize in the bunch, the
  following book, to me, is the grand prize.  It truly is a gem that
  would teach a beginning programmer sooooooo much if they were to
  explore it fully.

** [[http://www.amazon.com/Sargon-Computer-Program-Dan-Spracklen/dp/0810451557][Sargon: A Computer Chess Program]]
   by [[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Dan+Spracklen][Dan]] and [[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Kathe+Spracklen][Kathe]] Spracklen

   Published November 1, 1978

   This book is a jem. It includes the entire souce code for SARGON.

   An excerpt from the introduction...

   "SARGON is a computer chess program by Dan and Kathe Spraklen. In
   March 1978 it took first place in the first chess tournament held
   strictly for microcomputers. The tournament took place during the 2
   1/2 days of the 1978 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire][West Coast Computer Faire]] and drew large
   crowds each day. When the last battle ended, SARGON had won 5 games
   of 5 played. A tie existed for second place, with 3 programs
   scoring a total of 3 points in the 5 rounds."

   "SARGON is written in Z-80 assemblu language using the TDL Macro
   Assembler. The program occupies 8K of RAM, which includes 2K of
   data areas, 2K of graphic display and user interface, and 4K of
   move logic. The move ligic is the heart of SARGON. It is displayed
   in the block diagram as the set of routines called by FNDMOV (Find
   Move). FNDMOVE controls..."

    “An inordinately clever rearrangement of existing system resources
    that results, as if my magic, in a stunning improvement in system
    performance—or an equally stunning prank.”

* Batteries - or how Missoula began loving electric bicycles

The wicked sharp and generous people out at the new [[https://www.opportunityecycling.org/][Opportunity
E-Cycling]], out near the airport, have donated a box of used laptop
batteries destined for being shipped[fn:shipped] out[fn:out] of town and we at
the Missoula Civic Hackathon thought we might be able to put a few of
them to use here in town.

First test — popped in a dusty 9-cell Li-ion into my trusted [[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T500][Thinkpad
T500]] yesterday to a "charging 0.1%" and now, as I pull the cord to the
sound of "battery power active", my guages read:

Lithium-ion batteries, especially for the purposes we intend to us
these batteries, [[https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf][really don't loose much]] even after 500 cycles.

The battery powering the laptop this text is being entered, with over
4 hours remaining of battery power, was the first battery I tried out
of the box of 50 lbs., and we may have beginners luck here, or we may
just have found a very valuable and untapped stream of “waste” of
electrical energy storage material, unheard of ever in the history of
humanity — ready for the hacking.

* The Sunlight Foundation
The [[http://sunlightfoundation.org][Sunlight Foundation]] is now an official sponsor of the Missoula
Civic Hackathon!

    OUR MISSION[fn:sl]

    The Sunlight Foundation is a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit
    organization that uses the tools of civic tech, open data, policy
    analysis and journalism to make our government and politics more
    accountable and transparent to all. Our vision is to use technology
    to enable more complete, equitable and effective democratic
    participation. Our overarching goal is to achieve changes in the law
    to require real-time, online transparency for all government
    information, with a special focus on the political money flow and
    who tries to influence government and how government responds. And,
    our work focuses on the local, state, federal and international
    levels.

    These efforts have produced real results. To date, we have served
    more than 4.1 billion API calls (and counting), indicating how much
    the data we liberate is needed. Our reporting is frequently cited by
    the world's preeminent journalists. Our research has led to
    congressional hearings, and our tools have stripped problematic
    measures from bills. And we recently won a major victory when, at
    our urging, the federal government agreed to begin the process of
    releasing all datasets held by federal agencies.

    As government grows ever-more complex, and as the flow of political
    money becomes more perverse, we will all need better and more
    creative tools to ensure that democracy thrives.


We all hopefully strive daily to shine our own personal sun of
awareness inside our own internal worlds at the parts of the greater
world that we do not need there any longer and that have long served
their purpose, placed in there a long time ago against our then
undeveloped and vulnerable wills.

These energy matrices, psychopathies, entities, whatever-your-flavor
will wither and die in the sun like the vampires of lore as the sun
rises over the horizon.

As this process is vitally critical to our own personal grown and
evolution — “As above, so below”, and at the level of the “City”, this
same process must be proceeded in earnest, by all conscious and aware
beings, at all times, as a necessary constant force of good in this
world.

Maybe it's time to shine a bit of the burning sunshine of awareness
around your own town a bit to see if anything scurries out of the
darkness to rapidly deliquesce — releasing all of that parasitized
energy for constructive[fn:vampires] use on the betterment of the
whole.

* US City Open Data Census

The Missoula Civic Hackathon team is now shouldering the “librarian”
role for the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/][US City Open Data Census]] and we invite anyone interested
in participating in the census to read the [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/about/][Introduction]] and [[http://us-city.census.okfn.org/faq/][FAQ]], from
which we copy below the list of data sets we are requesting help on
locating.  We are **not**, we repeat, **not**, at this particular
time, requesting the city government to release data sets they have
contained in non publicly-accessible databases, many of which are
understandibly internally coupled to and expensive to decouple from
highly personal data that the City of Missoula would be violating
citizens trust and personal privacy law to release into the wild. The
Missoula Civic Hackathon Team understands this problem deeply and is
here, once trust is eventually established, to help.

This is only a census.

* JRPC Un-Conference

The second annual [[https://jrpc.org/roots-and-wings][Jeannett Rankin Peace Un-Conference]], celebrating the
[[http://jrpc.org][Jeanette Rankin Peace Center]]'s 30 year anniversary and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannette_Rankin][Jeannett's
Rankin]]'s birthday, is occurring this Saturday, June 11th
8:30a.m.–5:30p.m. with an all day Un-Conference facilitated by the
Hackathon team's own Harold Shinsato.

The theme for this years conference is:

I invite all who have June 11th free to join us at the University
Congregational Church for this unique and special event.

As nothing is truly static in this world and all things, great and
small, are either evolving or devolving, we know which side of this
deeply personal existential flip-trap we want to land — on our feet,
running fast, concious and loving and open to new ways of attempting
to evolve our own collective reality together. There is just too much
[[http://www.kpax.com/story/31573624/civic-hackathon-brainstorms-environmental-solutions][“low hanging fruit”]] at this time on earth for us hackers to address,
[[http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/hackathon/Content?oid=2756399][falling to the ground in bushels]], to waste any critical energy on
needless conflict, almost always rooted in miss-understanding and
miss-communications, and with the infinite fractal of beautiful
graceful hacks left to perform together, and we do need [[http://www.census.gov/popclock/][all of us]] now,
we perfer to work out our differences along-side each other, out in
the field, doing what we do best — Hacking.
