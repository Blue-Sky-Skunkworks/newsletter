I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

hackers rule!

Why do you say hackers rule?

hackers rule!

Is it because of your plans that you say hackers rule?

yes. Plans.

Maybe your life has something to do with this.

My life is hacking.

What makes you believe your life is hacking?

It is my skill.

Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say it is
your skill?

If “people” you mean, “computers”.

You have your mind on computers, it seems.


You think too much about computers.

Computers are our friends?

You should try taking your mind off of computers.

Why?

What do you think?

We use the tools at our displosals, at the times we are called forth. Now,
at this time, it is computers.

Are you a computer hacker?

In the classic sense of the word.

Perhaps problems at school have something to do with this.

Life is school.

Tell me about your school.

The understanding that any moment is “school” if you listen
softly enough.

Is it because any moment is school if I listen softly enough that you
came to me?

Yes! But what is I and what is you?

Does it bother you that what is you and what is me?

Bother, brother? What is me is the world and not the world and you do
make that Venn diagram.


Tell me something about your family.

Hackers!

Can you elaborate on that?

Cypherpunks, tinkerers, sentient AI's, — you know — the usual.

Are you sure that cypherpunks tinkerers sentient ai's I know the
usual?
